This project is to develop articles recommendation service in IBM Watson Studio platform. To give proper recommendation, rank base, user-user based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization are used.
  
## Contained Files
1. **Test Code**  
Since this project is provided to students of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, There are some test codes. Following lists are test codes. `project_tests.py`, `top_10.p`, `top_20.p`, `top_5.p`, `user_item_matrix.p`  
2. **Data**  
In `data` folder, `articles_comunity.csv` and `user-item-interactions.csv` are stored. The former file contains the information related to articles, and the latter file contains the information related to the interactions between users and articles.
